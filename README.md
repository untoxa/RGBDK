# RGBDK experimental library

Recent SDCC builds support mappings for RGBDS assembler (it was broken quite for a while, approx. 10 years).

This is an attempt to make some kind of library, that allows to use 
advantages of both RGBDS assembler and SDCC C compiler.

You need SDCC 4.1.6 #12439 or higher for here: http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/snap.php 

You need RGBDS 0.5.0 or higher from here: https://github.com/rednex/rgbds/releases

Based on gb-starter-kit by ISSOtm: https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-starter-kit

I appriciate your help and feedback. 

Tony.
